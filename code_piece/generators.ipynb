    ">First lets understand iterators. According to Wikipedia, an iterator is an object that enables a programmer to traverse a container, particularly lists. However, an iterator performs traversal and gives access to data elements in a container, but does not perform iteration. You might be confused so lets take it a bit slow. There are three parts namely:\n",

    ">* Iterable\n",
    "* Iterator\n",
    "* Iteration\n",

    ">All of these parts are linked to each other. We will discuss them one by one and later talk about generators.\n",

    "## 3.1. Iterable\n",
    ">An iterable is any object in Python which has an __iter__ or a __getitem__ method defined which returns an iterator or can take indexes (Both of these dunder methods are fully explained in a previous chapter). In short an iterable is any object which can provide us with an iterator. So what is an iterator?\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3.2. Iterator\n",
    ">An iterator is any object in Python which has a next (Python2) or __next__ method defined. That’s it. That’s an iterator. Now let’s understand iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3.3. Iteration\n",
    ">In simple words it is the process of taking an item from something e.g a list. When we use a loop to loop over something it is called iteration. It is the name given to the process itself. Now as we have a basic understanding of these terms let’s understand generators.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3.4. Generators\n",
    ">Generators are iterators, but you can only iterate over them once. It’s because they do not store all the values in memory, they generate the values on the fly. You use them by iterating over them, either with a ‘for’ loop or by passing them to any function or construct that iterates. Most of the time generators are implemented as functions. However, they do not return a value, they yield it. Here is a simple example of a generator function:"

Generators are best for calculating large sets of results (particularly calculations involving loops themselves) where you don’t want to allocate the memory for all results at the same time. Many Standard Library functions that return lists in Python 2 have been modified to return generators in Python 3 because generators require fewer resources.\n",
